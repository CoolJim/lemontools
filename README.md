> Lemon tools is an open-sourced, completely free-to-use Discord bot with a few tricks up it's sleeves! It can fetch the news, fetch Coronavirus information and even spark a conversation

# How to self-host

Firstly, Download a copy of the source code. You should have NodeJS (v16.10.x +) installed on your machine, and yarn already installed.

After that, run these commands

```bash
$ touch .env
$ nano .env # Edit the env file with your secrets. Take a look at the example file to see what fields are needed
$ touch config.yaml
$ nano config.yaml # Edit config.yaml with your wanted values. Take a look at config.example.yaml for an example
```

Open a terminal window in the directory where you have the code. Type these commands:

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

Once that is done, run

```bash
$ node ./build
```

The bot should start. If it does not, open an [Issue](https://github.com/cooljim/lemontools/issues/new) describing your problem.
